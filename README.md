Biomathematics modelisations : Leslie Prey-Predator System
----------------------------------------------------------

Scilab code to simulate differential system solutions.

In 1948, Leslie introduced a prey-predator model that has a predator-like environmental support capacity that is proportional to the number of prey items. Leslie advances the
that the growth rate of predators as well as that of prey, admits an upper limit. This upper limit can be approximated under certain favorable conditions:
- for the predator when the number of preys is high,
- for prey, when the number of predators (and perhaps the number of prey
also) is weak.
This assertion is not recognized in the case of Lotka-Volterra type systems.
